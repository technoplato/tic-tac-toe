### Assumptions / Constraints

I tried to avoid making any unnecessary assumptions other than following the standard rules of Tic Tac Toe. 

The constraints of the application in its current state are that gameplay is local multiplayer only. The code was written in a wy that will allow for these constraints to be lifted fairly easily in the future.

### Fun Potential Stretch Goals

- Add Multiplayer Support with Firebase
- Allow user to play on arbitrarily sized board
- Nice animations and styling
- Add local single player
